## Transparency and reporting

For transparency, [we are publishing an anonymised record of all donations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTD4KzlqbbzGBbooGgkL0mBJUtU8fyDhPOZQEv33vyid0yRnR4PF1CEjbRE_RozpIoKZcbKrzLLPo4t/pubhtml). All funds will be accounted for in our post-conference report.

However you send it, every single penny that we receive in donations will be used to assist travellers on low budgets.
